Say there are directories which contain CSV files listing the power usage for several housing bricks in married student housing
you need to list the usage and aggregate them

The directory structure that was used for this program

files
├── 20141112
│   └── usage.csv
├── 20141113
│   └── usage.csv
├── 20141114
│   └── usage.csv
└── someotherfile.txt

all the CSV files look like this(tabs)

brick	power
1	12
2	13
4	14

Yeah ... I'm lazy ...  I only created one
